    VectorNumber provides a Numeric-like experience for doing arithmetics on heterogeneous objects, with more advanced operations based on real vector spaces available when needed.

    Features:
    - Add and subtract (almost) any object, with no setup or declaration.
    - Multiply and divide vectors by any real number to create 1.35 of an array and -2 of a string. What does that mean? Only you know!
    - Use vectors instead of inbuilt numbers in most situtations with no difference in behavior. Or, use familiar methods from numerics with sane semantics!
    - Enumerate vectors in a hash-like fashion, or transform to an array or hash as needed.
    - Enjoy a mix of vector-, complex- and polynomial-like behavior at appropriate times.
    - No dependencies, no extensions. It just works!
